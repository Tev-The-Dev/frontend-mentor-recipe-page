## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I learned that I can use the dev-tools to inspect the webpage and resize it to view it as the various sized phones. This helped me in making sure that my design resized well to accommodate the 375px smart-phone standard in the style-guide
To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

/*Optimizing for mobile*/
@media screen and (max-width: 375px) {
    body{
        padding: 0;
        width: 100%;
    }
    main{
        width: 100%;
        border-radius: 0;
        padding: 0;

    }
    img {
        border-radius: 0;
        width: 100%;
        
    }
}

### Continued development

I want to be able to understand and quickly scale web pages to differnt sized dependent on the requirements. In this case, it was only required that I made sure it would scale to 375px, but there are now phones of different sizes and I need to be able to guage the appropriate scaling for those too. 

### Useful resources

- [HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) - This helped me to get all of my html code up to spec and standardized. 

- [CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) - Same as with the HTML Validator, this helped me to get my CSS organized and standardized with some best practices, as well as check to make sure.

-[Copilot](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot/personal-ai-assistant) - I used Copilot to do code reviews to make sure my code wasn't missing any semi-colons or any other sytactical errors that I may have missed. It also helped me when I couldn't figure out why my alignment wasn't working properly on the table when everything else aligned. Using AI in this way helped me code faster instead of trial and error-ing my code to see what would happen
